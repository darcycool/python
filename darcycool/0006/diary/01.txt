Our goal is to generate for you a complete and modern Web app or microservice architecture, unifying:

A high-performance and robust Java stack on the server side with Spring Boot
A sleek, modern, mobile-first front-end with Angular and Bootstrap
A robust microservice architecture with JHipster Registry, Netflix OSS, ELK stack and Docker
A powerful workflow to build your application with Yeoman, Webpack/Gulp and Maven/Gradle
